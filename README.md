# Concurrent Merge Sort

Implement the Merge Sort algorithm using the `java.util.concurrent` package to leverage multithreading for improved performance.

- Complete the implementation of the `MergeSortAction` class. 
- Make use of `RecursiveTask` or `RecursiveAction` classes to divide the sorting task into smaller, parallel tasks.
- Feel free to use `ConcurrentMergeSortExample` to test your application in the main method, or use test cases to verify your application works as expected
